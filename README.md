# odin-landing-page
This project utilizes concepts of flexbox and styling, made in pure HTML5 and CSS3 to create a webpage fit for all browsing resolutions.

I was able to apply my newly learned skills in creating a landing-page based on the reference images that can be found in the reference-images directory.

It was a very much enjoyable project that I had fun making and learned concepts beyond what the course had taught, such as styling images, rounded borders, and webpage icons.
